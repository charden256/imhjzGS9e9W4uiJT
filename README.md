### [1] Project Overview

This project—hosted in Jupyter Notebooks and executed partly via Google Colab (for model fine-tuning)—aims to build a system that can:

- Extract, process, and analyze candidate profile text (resumes, descriptions)  
- Compute similarity or relevance scores against keyword(s) or recruiter input  
- Rank candidates accordingly  
- Incorporate human preference / feedback to adjust or re-weight candidate rankings  
- Optionally refine the ranking model using fine-tuning (e.g. via Hugging Face)  

It consists of:
- `Potential Talents.ipynb` (runs in Jupyter Notebook)
- `Potential Talents_Part2.ipynb` (runs in Jupyter Notebook)
- `2_HF_gemma_finetuning-from googlecolab.ipynb` (runs in Google Colab)

### [2] Prerequisites

- Python = 3.8  
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab or access to Google Colab  
- Required libraries (example):  
  ```text
  pandas
  numpy
  scikit-learn
  sentence-transformers
  transformers
  torch / tensorflow (depending on backend)
  nltk / spaCy (for preprocessing)

### [3] Step-by-Step Workflow

Below is a more detailed, stepwise flow of what a user (or you) would execute:

| Step | Description | Input / Output |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Load dataset of candidate profiles (CSV) | `talents.csv` or `potential-talents.csv` ? DataFrame |
| 2 | Preprocess text | Clean text, lowercase, tokenize, remove punctuation/stopwords |
| 3 | Encode text & query | Use embedding model (TF-IDF, SentenceTransformers, etc.) |
| 4 | Compute similarity scores | Cosine similarity (or other metric) between query and each candidate |
| 5 | Rank candidates | Sort descending by similarity |
| 6 | User feedback integration | Accept flagged candidates or preference input |
| 7 | Adjust ranking | Re-weight or re-score accordingly |
| 8 | (Optional) Fine-tune model | Use Hugging Face / transformers in Colab to refine embedding model |
| 9 | Generate final results | Output top K candidate list + interpretation |

In the `2_HF_gemma_finetuning` notebook, the steps usually include:

- Preparing a dataset of (candidate, keyword) pairs  
- Defining model architecture / loss  
- Running training epochs / evaluation  
- Saving the fine-tuned model  
- Applying that to rank or embed candidate profiles  

### [4] What you should take away

This project showcases end-to-end capability: from data ingestion through text embedding, similarity ranking, human-in-the-loop feedback, to fine-tuning advanced models.

It underscores practical understanding of NLP pipelines, transformer models, and embedding strategies in a domain-specific context (candidate matching).

I clearly added value by bridging automation and human expertise — the system is not purely black-box, but allows domain-level adjustments (feedback) to shape results.

For roles in data science, machine learning, NLP, or AI-based systems, this project demonstrates my technical depth (modeling, evaluation, fine-tuning) as well as product thinking (how a recruiter or user might use it).

When reviewing your contributions, hiring managers can trace my work and reasoning through notebooks, understand my modeling decisions, and see my adaptability in using Colab / Hugging Face.
