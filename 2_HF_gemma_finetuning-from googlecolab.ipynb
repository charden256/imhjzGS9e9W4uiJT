    "The project 3 deals with finding candidates that fit into categories and finding how similar they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency is what TF-IDF means and is what I started with.\n",
    "TF-IDF finds the frequency or amount of times that the word exists in a document given the number of words in a document, and this is the word's importance. The search term was used to find the cosine similarity between the search term and corpus. The answer showed how similar the search term was between different parts of the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "I needed to find the word embeddings or a word's numerical representations so I utilized the three following libraries: Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. I used the search term \"aspiring human resources\" for the word embeddings libraries and compared it to the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google's Word2Vec was the first library I used. A word's relationships are compared with word2vec. Words used in a similar context to the same word in it's context have similar meanings. The neighboring words build the word embeddings for every word in a document or corpus. The Word2Vec gave the cosine similarity values of the search term to the corpus and listed them in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stanford University's GloVe was the next library I used. GloVe stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation. GloVe builds a co-occurrence matrix for each word with the goal of comparing how often words appear with one another in a document or corpus. The results of the GloVe were similar to Word2Vec as they were in descending order, but the cosine similarity values were different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Facebook's FastText was the last library I used. FastText breaks up words into smaller n-grams or subwords. The result of this for a word the n-gram's sum or average is the final vector. The results of the FastText were similar to Word2Vec and GloVe as they were in descending order, but the cosine similarity values were different.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT is a sentence transformer. BERT was used with cosine similarity to find contextual embeddings which shows their semantic similarity. BERT reads both from left to right and from right to left simultaneously. The entire sentence is used with BERT and it also give a cosine similarity score like previous libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch from Facebook is a machine learning framework used in natural language processing. PyTorch was utilized to find the embeddings score along with the old and new scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "File 2 used PyTorch, which was used with the SmolLM2, Alibaba's Qwen, and Meta's Llama models from HuggingFace. The models are large language models (LLMs) and are generative AI models. I asked the questions to the models and they thought about what to say, giving their best answer. Next I loaded my job titles list and search term and the model thought of the best answers and how similar they were.\n",
    "\n",
    "In File 3 the last task, which was to perform was fine-tuning. Fine-tuning works by choosing a task that is specific and training it on a smaller dataset. Google's Gemma was the model used for fine-tuning. My model found job titles similar to the term data science and listed the top 5."
